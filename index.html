<!-- Project 1 Section -->
<div>
<h1>Project 1: Flarf</h1>
<p> For this project, students were to practice creating a website with a flarf poem. Although it can be described <br> as 'incoherrent', a Flarf poem is by taking a phrase and searching it up on the internet. You take the first couple website <br> along with image results and use those to create a poem. You are allowed to change some <br> things up to make your best work. My words were 'Girl, I think I messed up' which created my work <br> <a href= "https://mimii20.github.io/PROJECT_1_mimii20/"> Love-ache</a>. </p>

<!-- Project 2 Section -->
<div>
<h1> Project 2: Green Screen </h1>
<p> For this project, we were to make a background (specifically an animated or video-type one) which could be <br> used as a zoom background. I decided to try out puppet animation in AE with Hatsune Miku. <br> This <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iJifq9cq23UHr1YFZpRfAy6Qgcx72AUY/view?usp=sharing">video </a> shows the final result.</p>

<!-- Project 3 Section -->
<div>
<h1> Project 3: Twine</h1>
<p> For this project, we were to create a non-linear twine game. For my game, it was one of coming <br> to terms with grief and sorrow. While short, it was created in a way where players are allowed to choose to deal <br> with grief's stages in the way they want to. This also reflects how different people in real life deal with grief differently.</p>
